//Consider move sample.py to ./sample/ folder including __init__.py, core.py(which is sample.py) and helpers.py.
//Python provides a very straightforward packaging system, which is simply an extension of the module mechanism to a directory.
Any directory with an __init__.py file is considered a Python package. The different modules in the package are imported in a similar manner as plain modules, but with a special behavior for the __init__.py file, which is used to gather all package-wide definitions.

* * Here, I reached a crossroads.
    Should I use this single project as a whole solution for the authorization-system?
    When reading the difference between web application and other websites, finally I came to a conclusion that I don't want that both my
    front end will be implemented in Python and I should apply the SoC principle as my architectural design guideline because of its cons.
    * Should I use REST? it seems pretty popular among other apis.
    * Should I use Multitier (N-Tier) architectural pattern? is it the same as REST?
    * Should I use SOAP? I think this is a protocol so... is it instead of REST? understand that!
    * Should I user XML or JSON for data transfer between tiers?
    * Should I create a API? I think I should..

* Understand the difference between web application and other web sites.
* Understand what CGI and WSGI are.
* (https://wiki.python.org/moin/Templating) Consider which will be your templating system - Django, pyTenjin, pystache, Mako, Jinja2, Cheetah, http://jonpy.sourceforge.net, Ophelia, Chameleon, wheezy.template
* Or you'll need a framework, but you need to consider is it maintained and how new and up-to-date is it, such as: mod_wsgi, TurboGears, web2py, Bottle, Flask, Pyramid, Tornado
* But first check https://github.com/makaimc/compare-python-web-frameworks

Consider make a mockup.
setup.py should obviously be at the same folder as the module package.
If your project has no development dependencies, or you prefer development environment setup via setup.py, requirements.txt may be unnecessary.
Read http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/ before using tests.
Consider you to implement the front-end, using which framework or elements.
Understand the CGI usage (http://www.pythonschool.net/server-side-scripting/preparing-for-your-first-script/)
