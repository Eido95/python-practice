Consider move sample.py to ./sample/ folder including __init__.py, core.py(which is sample.py) and helpers.py.
Python provides a very straightforward packaging system, which is simply an extension of the module mechanism to a directory.
Any directory with an __init__.py file is considered a Python package. The different modules in the package are imported in a similar manner as plain modules, but with a special behavior for the __init__.py file, which is used to gather all package-wide definitions.

Consider make a mockup.
setup.py should obviously be at the same folder as the module package.
If your project has no development dependencies, or you prefer development environment setup via setup.py, requirements.txt may be unnecessary.
Read http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/ before using tests.
